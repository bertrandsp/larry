# ✅ Larry Backend Service - Setup Complete!

## 🎉 What We've Accomplished

### ✅ Task 1: Bootstrap Backend
- ✅ Initialized Node.js project with TypeScript
- ✅ Added Express, CORS, dotenv, and supporting types
- ✅ Created `/src/app.ts` with `/health` endpoint
- ✅ Configured environment variables

### ✅ Task 2: Setup Prisma + PostgreSQL
- ✅ Installed Prisma + @prisma/client
- ✅ Created `prisma/schema.prisma` with complete models
- ✅ Configured DATABASE_URL in .env.example
- ✅ Generated Prisma client successfully

### ✅ Task 3: Setup Redis + BullMQ
- ✅ Installed Redis client + BullMQ packages
- ✅ Added REDIS_URL to .env.example

### ✅ Task 4: Define Prisma DB Schema
- ✅ Created complete schema with all required models:
  - User (with email, subscription, topics)
  - Topic (with name, canonicalSet relation)
  - UserTopic (user-topic associations with weights)
  - Term (vocabulary terms with definitions, examples, metadata)
  - Fact (related facts for topics)
  - CanonicalSet (canonical term sets)

### ✅ Task 5: Create Basic REST API Endpoints
- ✅ Created modular API structure in `/src/api/`
- ✅ Implemented all required endpoints:
  - `GET /health` - Health check
  - `POST /user` - Create user
  - `GET /user/:userId` - Get user
  - `POST /user/topics` - Create topic and associate with user
  - `GET /user/:userId/topics` - Get user's topics
  - `PUT /user/topics/:userTopicId` - Update topic weight
  - `DELETE /user/topics/:userTopicId` - Remove topic from user
  - `GET /user/:userId/terms` - Get user's terms
  - `GET /user/terms/:topicId` - Get topic terms
  - `POST /user/terms` - Create term
  - `GET /user/facts/:topicId` - Get topic facts
  - `POST /user/facts` - Create fact

## 🧪 Testing Results

The API is fully functional and tested:

```bash
# Health endpoint working
curl http://localhost:3000/health
# Returns: {"status":"ok","timestamp":"2025-08-28T22:50:10.594Z","version":"1.0.0"}

# Run full test suite
npm test
# All tests pass ✅
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (Week 3)
1. **Set up PostgreSQL database**
   ```bash
   # Create database and run migrations
   npm run prisma:migrate
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your database URL
   ```

3. **Test database operations**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # Test user creation, topic management, etc.
   ```

### Future Enhancements
- **Queue Pipeline** - BullMQ integration for background processing
- **OpenAI Integration** - AI-powered term and fact generation
- **Authentication** - JWT-based user authentication
- **Rate Limiting** - API rate limiting and cost controls
- **Real-time Updates** - WebSocket support

## 🎯 Deliverables Status

| Sample .env file and README | ✅ Complete |

## 🔧 Available Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run start        # Start production server
npm test             # Run API tests
npm run prisma:generate  # Generate Prisma client
