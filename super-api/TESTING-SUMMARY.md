## 🔍 Detailed Test Analysis

### **1. Term Normalization & Cleaning**
- **Input**: `"Machine Learning."` → **Output**: `"machine learning"`
- **Input**: `"  neural   network  "` → **Output**: `"neural network"`
- **Input**: `"AI/ML"` → **Output**: `"aiml"`
- **Input**: `"Blockchain!"` → **Output**: `"blockchain"`
- **Input**: `"Cloud Computing?"` → **Output**: `"cloud computing"`
- **Input**: `""Quantum Computing""` → **Output**: `"quantum computing"`
- **Input**: `"Edge Computing..."` → **Output**: `"edge computing"`
- **Input**: `"   spaced   words   "` → **Output**: `"spaced words"`

**✅ All normalization cases working correctly**

### **2. Confidence-Based Deduplication**
- **Original terms**: 4
- **After deduplication**: 2
- **Duplicates removed**: 2
- **Logic verified**: Higher confidence scores preferred, verified sources preferred over GPT-generated

**✅ Deduplication logic working correctly**

### **3. Post-Processing Pipeline**
- **Processing**: 5 terms for topic "Artificial Intelligence"
- **Normalized**: 5 terms
- **Deduplicated**: 4 terms (removed 1 duplicate)
- **Enriched**: 4 terms with metadata
- **Metadata includes**: Confidence scores, complexity levels, categories, verification status

**✅ Complete pipeline working correctly**

### **4. Canonical Set Management**
- **New topic creation**: ✅ Working
- **Existing topic reuse**: ✅ Working
- **Canonical set creation**: ✅ Working
- **Topic isolation**: ✅ Working (different topics get different canonical sets)

**✅ Canonical set management working correctly**
